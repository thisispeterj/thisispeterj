# My Journey to Developer Advocate: What's Coming Next

After years of building user interfaces and optimizing user experiences, I've made the leap to developer advocacy. But this isn't just a career changeâ€”it's an opportunity to share my passion for quality assurance and test automation with the broader developer community.

## Welcome to My Blog!

This blog is just getting started, but I have big plans! As someone who's spent years in QA and automation, I'm excited to bring practical, hands-on content that helps developers build better, more reliable applications.

## What You Can Expect

### ðŸŽ­ Playwright Deep Dives

I'll be launching a comprehensive series on **Playwright**â€”one of the most powerful tools for modern web testing. From basic setup to advanced automation patterns, we'll cover:

- Getting started with Playwright for beginners
- Advanced testing strategies and best practices
- Cross-browser testing techniques
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Performance testing with Playwright

### ðŸ¤– Playwright + MCP Integration

One of the most exciting topics I'll be covering is the integration between **Playwright and Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This cutting-edge combination opens up incredible possibilities for intelligent test automation and AI-assisted quality assurance.

### ðŸ“š QA Automation Focus

Beyond Playwright, expect content on:

- Test automation architecture and design patterns
- API testing strategies
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing automation
- Performance testing methodologies

## Why This Matters

Quality assurance isn't just about finding bugsâ€”it's about enabling teams to move fast with confidence. Through automation, we can create safety nets that allow developers to innovate without fear of breaking things.

## Skills That Transfer

My journey has taught me that the best advocates combine:

- **Technical Depth** â†’ Deep understanding of the tools and challenges
- **Communication Skills** â†’ Ability to explain complex concepts clearly
- **Real-World Experience** â†’ Practical knowledge from actually using these tools in production

## Stay Tuned!

This is just the beginning. I'm working on several exciting posts and tutorials that will help you level up your testing game. Whether you're a developer looking to add testing to your toolkit or a QA engineer wanting to embrace automation, there's something coming for you.

**Follow along for practical tutorials, real-world examples, and insights from the trenches of modern software quality assurance!**

The journey continues, and I can't wait to share what I've learned with all of you! ðŸš€
